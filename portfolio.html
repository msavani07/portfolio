      <img class="portfolio" src= "assets/x wing.PNG" alt="An image of an x wing fighter model that was created using a three dimensional aid">
      <p>In my Intro to Engineering Design class, I made a group project where I used a CAD software to create an X-Wing Fighter from Star Wars. This is the final product.</p>

      <img class="portfolio" src= "assets/cake.JPG" alt="An image of a three layer confetti cake with non frosted sides and a crumb on top.">
      <p>This is a three layer confetti cake that I made. It is a copy of the Milk bar Confetti Cake, which I was taught to make in a baking course that I took during Covid.</p>
